# Privacy Policy for Zone2Cycle

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Zone2Cycle. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy will inform you about our data practices when you use our app.

## 2. No Data Collection or Storage

Zone2Cycle is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or usage information. All data processing occurs locally on your device and is not recorded or sent to our servers or any third parties.

## 3. How the App Works

Zone2Cycle uses your heart rate data and controls your smart turbo trainer's power output in real-time to maintain your desired heart rate zone. This process happens entirely on your device. No data is saved after your training session ends.

## 4. Device Permissions

Our app requires Bluetooth permissions to connect with your smart turbo trainer and heart rate monitor. On Android devices, Bluetooth permissions may require access to location services. This is a requirement of the Android operating system for Bluetooth functionality and is not used by our app to determine or track your location. We do not access, collect, or store any location data.

## 5. Third-Party Services

Our app may interface with your smart turbo trainer or heart rate monitor. Please refer to the privacy policies of these device manufacturers for information on how they handle data.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page.
